# Automatic Number Plate Detection Using OpenCV
 Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a crucial technology in modern traffic management and security systems. It enables automatic detection and recognition of vehicle number plates from images or video feeds. This project aims to develop a real-time number plate detection system using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers. The system captures video from a webcam, detects number plates, extracts the image, and saves the cropped images for further processing. The project is designed to be efficient, accurate, and user-friendly, making it suitable for various applications such as traffic surveillance, toll collection, and parking management.
